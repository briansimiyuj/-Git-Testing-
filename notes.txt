When you want to edit past commits, you can make the changes, then commit them. 

Run `git log --online` to look for the commit you want to edit, in this case we want to edit {d16496f Container markup} commit. Go to the base or previous commit and copy the hash. in our case, our base commit is {f63a902 Added index file}

Then run `git rebase -i <commit hash>,` in this case `git rebase -i f63a902`
